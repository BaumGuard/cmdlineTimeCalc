# cmdlineTimeCalc
A small java program for converting time units in different ways.

This is a java command line program which can be executed by running `java -jar ctc.jar`.
Apart from just converting a time value into another decimal number and sum up times, this program also has the ability to split time values into its subunits eg 500 seconds into 8 minutes and 20 seconds. This feature also works in reverse.

If you are facing problems with the program or have suggestions for making the program better, do not hesitate to contact me.
